We'll do a Youtube video later but the project is submitted. Had trouble creating the binaries so just opened our repo to the public.

Western Defender code and assets repo: https://github.com/DevsInTheShed/pyGameJam2021

You can play it via running the python code on Linux/Mac/Windows and following these steps till the binaries are up:

* Make sure to have Python 3.9.6 or higher installed (older versions may work but we haven't tested and Python 3.9 had a nice performance bump)

* Install the required packages:
    ```bash 
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ``` 
* Run the project with python:
    ```python
    python3 main.py
    ```

Below is a small taste:
