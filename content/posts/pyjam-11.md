We'll do a Youtube video later but the project is submitted. Had trouble creating the binaries so just opened our repo to the public.

Western Defender code and assets repo: https://github.com/DevsInTheShed/pyGameJam2021

Pygame Jam submission link: https://itch.io/jam/pygame-community-summer-team-jam/rate/1145324

You can play it via running the python code and following these steps till the binaries are up:

* Install the required packages:
    ```bash 
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ``` 
* Run the project with python:
    ```python
    python3 main.py
    ```

Below is a small taste:
