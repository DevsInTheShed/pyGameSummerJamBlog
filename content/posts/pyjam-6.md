Over the past day and a bit, I have been working on some background music to be used during gameplay. Western music is a little bit challenging since it relies very heavily on acoustic instruments. I started off with a western style guitar sample and overlayed some drums, violin and sweep effects for the intro. The drums in the beginning have a Dubstep kind of vibe to them, but I felt it needed to be a bit faster paced to match the gameplay. So it drops into a 160bpm drum and bass style section with a neurofunk bass sound. This section was what was shown on the stream.

I definitely didn't think this was enough to loop over during gameplay and wanted to add something else to make it less monotonous. So it goes into a second breakdown and then builds up into a slow UK Hardcore style drop with some added western style samples. The little chiptune melody used in this drop is actually inspired from some of the music from the original Halloween Harry (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ48M0R-LnM&t=93s @ 1:33). I'm actually surprised it fit in with the key the track was in already.

I tried to get it to wrap around as best I could so that the audio could be looped seamlessley. The mixdown still has a few things that need fixing. The whip sounds might sound too close to weapon sounds in game.
