Have been working on the player character using aseprite (https://www.aseprite.org/) and wanted to give you all a little behind the scenes peek on this process. 

I start with the outline of the character, basically sketch something out with a base colour until we're happy with the proportions and shapes of the character:

Next we start to experiment with base colours. With these we want the character to be able to stand out against the background, but also I need to keep in mind we only have 32x32 pixels to work with - need to make the best use of each pixel!

We also wanted to fit the theme of the Halloween Harry character time travelling to the Wild West so gave him boots and a cowboy hat:

We wanted to add a little more colour to represent the cowboy clothes so added a little gold next, you can see how much of a difference a few pixels here and there make:

Lastly, we wanted to make the to add a bit more detail around the character gripping the shotgun as well as build out his arm muscles:

There you have it! Next stop is working out how to animate him :)
